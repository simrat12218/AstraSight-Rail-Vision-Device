# 🚆 AstraSight: Rail ki Nayi Disha

AstraSight is an advanced railway safety and situational awareness system designed to enhance train operations by detecting real-time obstacles, ensuring track clearance, and improving communication—all while significantly reducing infrastructure costs.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

In India, railways form the backbone of transportation, yet frequent accidents and unscheduled delays—especially due to sudden obstructions like animals, humans, or debris on the tracks—continue to pose serious challenges. AstraSight addresses this by integrating cutting-edge technologies to improve safety, efficiency, and decision-making **inside the locomotive** without requiring physical installations on the tracks.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Despite significant investment in traditional signaling and monitoring systems, accidents due to poor visibility, fog, and track intrusions remain common. Current systems are:
- Expensive to install and maintain
- Often dependent on centralized infrastructure
- Limited in remote or fog-prone regions

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **💡 Real-time Obstacle Detection** using TF-Luna/TFMini LiDAR sensors
- **📡 Long-Range Communication** via LoRa (Low Power Wide Area Network)
- **🖥️ Onboard TFT Display** to show live distance readings, track clearance, and signal status
- **🚦 LED-based Safety Signals** (Red-Yellow-Green) based on LiDAR and LoRa input
- **🛰️ GPS Integration (Future Scope)** for geotagged alerts and route tracking
- **🧠 Powered by FreeRTOS** for multitasking and responsive real-time performance
- **📉 Cost-Optimized Design** with up to **60% cost savings** compared to traditional systems

---

## 💰 Why AstraSight?

- **No trackside hardware needed** – all components are locomotive-mounted
- **Minimal infrastructure modification**
- **Open, modular, and scalable design**
- **60%+ cost reduction** compared to conventional obstacle detection and signaling solutions
- **Built with affordable microcontrollers (STM32), sensors, and open protocols**
